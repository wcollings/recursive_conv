# Recursive Convolution initialization and estimation

Included here is the code for an external module, written in C, that can be interfaced with a circuit simulator to perform recursive convolution.

The start is in `main.c`, which does the initialization and then goes into an infinite loop to perform the convolution

Also see the wiki (along the top bar), which has extensively documented the entire procedure
